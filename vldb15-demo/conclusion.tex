\section{Conclusion}
The prevalence of dirty data is a fundamental obstacle to modern data-driven applications.
We introduced \sys, a system that supports the iterative development of data cleaning workflows.
\sys allows the user to construct, adapt, and optimize cleaning plans with automated parameter recommendations, separating logical data cleaning operators from their physical implementations (e.g., rules, learning, or crowdsourced).
In our demo, we illustrate how \sys can be used to clean three real datasets, Zagat, Yelp, and Iowa Liquor Sales, with different physical implementations of the same logical Extraction and Entity Resolution workflow.
The physical implementations, while the same at a logical level, have different cleaning accuracies and our system aids the user in selecting the best options.
We have released an initial version of the code containing the core mechanisms for specifying cleaning plans, the operator API, and implementations of several physical operators.
