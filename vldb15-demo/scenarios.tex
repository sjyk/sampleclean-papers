\section{Demonstration}
In this section, we detail the proposed demonstration.
The objective of this demonstration is to illustrate 
how \sys enables the rapid iterative construction of data cleaning plans
and the ability to transfer workflows between similar dirty datasets.

\subsection{Datasets}
In our demo, we will consider cleaning workflows on three different datasets.
The first dataset contains 858 Zagat reviews\footnote{\scriptsize{ \url{cs.utexas.edu/users/ml/riddle/data/restaurant.tar.gz}}},
each tagged with the cuisine of the restaurant reviewed (e.g. ``Chinese" or ``French").
The second dataset, which is similar to the first, is from Yelp and contains 58,127 restaurant records that are also tagged with a category.
The third dataset consists of $3,049,914$ records of liquor sales from the state of Iowa\footnote{\scriptsize{\url{data.iowa.gov/Economy/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy}}}, including the store where the purchase occurred and the items and cost of the purchase.
In all three datasets, categorical columns are inconsistent across records (e.g. cuisine tags for ``Chinese" vs. ``Chinese Cuisine"), records are duplicated, and formatting errors abound. 
We will use \sys to resolve these errors and run aggregate queries over the cleaned datasets.

\subsection{Demo Walkthrough}
Now, we will detail the steps of the proposed demonstration.
A screenshot of our dashboard interface is illustrated in Figure~\ref{screenshot}.

\vspace{0.2em}

\noindent\textbf{Step 1: } Participants will select a dataset (e.g., the Zagat dataset), and load a pre-populated data cleaning plan and target query for it.
Participants will be able to manually tune the plan by choosing between Similarity Join implementations, adjusting their thresholds, and adding a crowdsourced filtering step in addition to similarity thresholding.

\noindent\textbf{Step 2: } At all times, the demo interface will display a representative sample of the input and output data for the cleaning plan as well as the results of the target query, allowing the participant to understand how cleaning affects the data. 
If a plan modification adds a crowdsourcing step, participants can complete crowd tasks in \sys's crowd interface.

\vspace{0.2em}

\noindent\textbf{Step 3:} Participants can further analyze their plan by clicking on an operator (Figure~\ref{screenshot-rec}).
This view will show the system's recommended changes to the operator and allow the participant to make those changes easily.
For example, Figure~\ref{screenshot-rec} shows a recommendation to change the similarity metric from Jaccard to Edit Distance since the attribute in question does not have many tokens.

\vspace{0.2em}

\noindent\textbf{Step 4: } Participants can then switch datasets. Switching between restaurant datasets (Zagat and Yelp) demonstrates how the same plan can perform on another dataset, while switching to the alcohol dataset demonstrates that \sys is effective in multiple data domains.
